Some basic, sample Webpack configs mostly to accompany my [Webpack is Awesome](https://speakerdeck.com/joshhunt/using-webpack-at-scale) talk.


To get up and running with these configs:

```
npm install -g webpack
npm install
webpack --config=1_basic-config.js
webpack --config=2_styles-config.js
webpack --config=3_plugins-config.js
```

And check the generated files in `dist/`
